# Halal Food Locator MVP
## Introduction
The Halal Food Locator is a convenient tool designed for users to easily discover Halal food establishments within a specific area. By entering a zip code and selecting a category (e.g., fast food, restaurant, grocery store), users can view relevant Halal establishments on an interactive map, each accompanied by its Google rating.

## Core Features
Zip Code and Category-Based Search:

*  Users provide a zip code.
* An optional dropdown menu allows users to select an establishment type: "Fast Food", "Restaurant", or "Grocery Store". If no category is chosen, it defaults to "Fast Food" and "Restaurant".
* Interactive Map Display:
* A dynamic map highlights Halal establishments corresponding to the user's search criteria.
* Map markers provide an overview of each location, including its name, address, and Google rating.
